        <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>This web app – PawFridge – was born as part of the learning activity and requirement of the TechUp programme held in May 2024. 
            Every web app is developed based on a problem statement that each participant defines. 
            PawFridge’s problem statement is found in the next section. 
            </p>

        <h1>The Problem Statement</h1>
            <p>The fridge at home can become cluttered with food items, and their locations within the fridge can be lost track of over time. 
            Some food could expire and gradually spoil, leading to bacterial and mold growth, which could make the fridge a health risk. The amount of expired food can be reduced if anyone at home can figure out the list of food items that are in the fridge, the compartments that they are located, and which ones are expiring. 
            The outcome is a safer and more efficient environment for food storage. 
        </p>

        <h1>User research prior to web app development</h1>
            <p>As part of the creation process, we are expected to conduct interviews (ref. design thinking) so that we may listen to different voices, confirm or reject our assumptions, and design a more useful web app. 
                Due to time limitation, I had only the chance to conduct pre-development five user interviews to validate the assumptions I have made in my initial problem statement. 
                Among the five, one user took the stance that she will never use the app, because “there’s more important things in life to remember than things in the fridge.” 
                Through this interaction, I learnt that people’s motivations are diverse, and it’s OK that the products we may create do not serve everyone. 
                The other four interviewees were however eager to share how they have been using their fridges, how they lose things in the fridges, and three of them look forward to having a means to tracking things in the fridge. 
            </p>
                <p>The following were some ideas new to me: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>People may forget what’s in their fridges, and this could lead to (1) buying more of existing items, and in turn may (2) cause ‘overcrowding’, and resulting in (3) food wastage due to expiry/rot/spoil </li>
                        <li>In households with helpers, the helpers are usually afraid of clearing items from the fridge as they are not sure if they have the permission to do it</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>The idea of empowering helpers was incorporated to improve PawFridge’s design.
            </p>        

            <p>The interviewees also shared their ‘wish list’ for PawFridge, which I look forward to developing and incorporating them in future versions. These include: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Barcode scanner for automatic cataloguing</li>
                    <li>Photo function for automatic cataloguing and recommending expiration dates</li>
                    <li>Expiration alerts via sms/whatsapp</li>
                    <li>Auto-tracking of ‘always buy’ items</li>
                    <li>Have links to shopping apps (e.g., NTUC, RedMart, Amazon Prime) for easy (re-)ordering of food items running out or low.</li>
                </ul>
            <br>I would like to hereby express my sincere thank you to the five interviewees for their valuable time and rich contribution of ideas that helped to shape PawFridge.
        </p>    
        
        <h1>Post-development reflection (alpha)</h1>
            <p>Through creating PawFridge, my knowledge of web development is no longer limited to HTML (here’s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980130114830/http:/www.kevii.nus.edu.sg/">link to my very first website</a>), 
                but my understanding of CSS and Javascript has deepened. 
                And for the first time I have created a website that interacts with a backend (postgreSQL) database. 
                GitHub, Codespaces, and Render, which are all new to me, are the ‘glue’ that binds the learning journey together.
            </p>
            <p>As I have much to learn, the current version of PawFridge is only made possible, given such a short timeframe, by two generative AI heroes (who happens to be related) – Microsoft CoPilot and ChatGPT4o. 
                Without the genAI's help in debugging and generating and regenerating codes, PawFridge would either be born a barebone HTML page, or who-knows-when-later. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for visiting and I hope you have fun interacting with this web app as much as the fun I had when creating it.
